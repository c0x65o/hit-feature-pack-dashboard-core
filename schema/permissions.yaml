    # - all: ignore scope (read everything, respecting visibility and shares)
    # - own: only owned dashboards (dashboard.owner_user_id === current user id)
    # - ldd: same as own (dashboards don't have LDD fields, so can't check LDD)
    #
    # These are mutually exclusive per node; the Security Groups UI renders them as dropdowns.
